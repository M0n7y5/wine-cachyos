/* Requires libpipewire-0.3 >= 1.2.0: pw_stream_get_data_loop() and struct
 * pw_loop::name.  The floor is the minimum API this file consumes, not the
 * version the ship vehicle carries; configure.ac records what it excludes.
 * An older library disables the driver there rather than failing the build,
 * so do not paper one over with version conditionals here.
 *
 * pw_loop_locked() arrived in 1.6.0, above the 1.4.2 steamrt4 ships, so
 * stream_loop_locked() below reconstructs it.  Check any newer entry point
 * exists in the runtime, not merely in the headers: most are static inlines
 * dispatching through a SPA interface, and spa_api_method_r returns its
 * default when the method is missing, so the call compiles, links, runs and
 * silently does nothing.  The i386 unixlib compounds this, building against
 * the container's own PipeWire while resolving against the runtime's. */
